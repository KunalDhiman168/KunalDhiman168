⭐ Hey, I Am Kunal ⭐

👋 About Me
As an aspiring engineer fascinated by electronics and robotics, I'm driven by my love for understanding how things work and solving complex problems related to circuits and semiconductors. With a hunger for learning and a strong work ethic, I'm eager to dive deeper into these fields and contribute to innovative solutions. 

Beyond Academics, I am a dedicated Fitness enthusiast who believes in pushing both physical and mental limits and focuses on self development.
